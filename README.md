This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).


# Finance Tracker

Finance Tracker is a mobile application built using the React Native framework, designed to help users manage their finances effectively. The application leverages Redux Toolkit for state management, allowing for seamless data sharing across all screens. The project is structured to facilitate future enhancements, ensuring that it can grow with new features as needed.

## Features

- **Add Expenses:** Users can add their expenses, including the amount, category, date, and description.
- **Add Income:** Users can also record their income with details such as amount, source, date, and description.
- **View Transactions:** A comprehensive view of all income and expenses with filtering options by date and category.
- **Category-wise Graphs:** Visual representation of income and expenses categorized to provide insights into financial patterns.


## Technologies Used

- **React Native:** A popular framework for building native mobile apps using JavaScript and React.
- **Redux Toolkit:** A toolset for efficient Redux development, providing streamlined state management and data sharing across components.


# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
